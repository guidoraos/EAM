# EAM

This Python 2.X program can be used to generate a LAMMPS-compatible SETFL file, for EAM-based MD simulations of liquid Bi, Pb, Ni and Fe and their mixtures.
THIS PROGRAM AND THE FILES GENERATED BY IT PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. IT IS THE USER'S RESPONSABILITY TO ENSURE THAT SIMULATIONS BASED ON THEM ARE EXECUTED, VALIDATED AND INTERPRETED CORRECTLY.
